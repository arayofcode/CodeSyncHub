# leetcode-sync

The GraphQL Queries have been taken from [Akarsh Jain's `leetcode-graphql-queries` Repo](https://github.com/akarsh1995/leetcode-graphql-queries/)

Things to work on:
- Improve logging
- Add testing
- Refactor
- Work on a daemon to automatically sync submissions
- Sync only the files that aren't same as before (with submissions made after timestamp of last sync)
- Send all files in a single commit instead of creating one file per commit
