# LeetCode-Sync

## Introduction
Hello! After LeetHub was discontinued, I found myself using several tools that would work for a while and then stop. As a result, I decided to build LeetCode-Sync as a replacement. Please note that the name is a placeholder for now, and I plan to change it in the near future. This is an open-source project, and contributions are warmly welcomed.

## Vision
My vision for LeetCode-Sync is to create an indispensable tool for coding enthusiasts and professionals. I aim to seamlessly integrate coding practice with professional portfolios, thereby enhancing the visibility of problem-solving skills and technical proficiency.

## Objectives
- **Automate Synchronization:** To facilitate the automatic syncing of code submissions from LeetCode to a user's chosen GitHub repository.
- **Enhance Portfolio Management:** To help users maintain an organized and up-to-date portfolio of their coding exercises.
- **User-Centric Features:** To develop features that add value for users, like categorizing problems by difficulty, tagging solutions for easy reference, and adding custom notes for each problem.
- **Community Collaboration and Feedback:** To encourage open-source contributions for continual improvement and feature additions.
- **Scalability and Reliability:** To ensure robust performance, capable of handling a large number of users and submissions.
- **Expand Compatibility:** Long-term, I aim to expand the tool's functionality to include integration with other coding platforms and support various programming languages.
