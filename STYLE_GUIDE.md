# Style Guide for CodeSyncHub

## Overview
This document outlines coding conventions and best practices to maintain consistency, readability, and quality in the CodeSyncHub project.

## Coding Conventions

### General Principles
- **Readability**: Write clear, understandable code with descriptive names for functions, variables, and classes.
- **Simplicity**: Favor simplicity over complexity. Avoid over-engineering.

### Python Specifics
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
- Use four spaces for indentation.

### Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling. Avoid silent failures and use meaningful error messages.

### Comments and Documentation
- Write comments for complex logic or areas where clarification may be needed.
- Use docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.

## Linting
- Use `flake8` for linting Python code.
- Run the linter locally before submitting a pull request.

## Testing
- Aim for comprehensive test coverage. Write unit tests for all new code where feasible.
- Follow Python's standard `unittest` framework for writing tests.

## Version Control

### Commits
- Write clear, concise commit messages. First line should be a summary (less than 50 characters), followed by a blank line and then a more detailed explanation if needed.

### Branching
- Use feature branches for new features (e.g., `feature/new-sync-feature`) and bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/issue-fix`).

## Performance
- Write efficient code. Be mindful of algorithm complexity and resource usage.

## Security
- Never commit sensitive data like tokens or secrets.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
